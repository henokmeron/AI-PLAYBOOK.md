## CURRENT

Updated: 2026-10-23T16:15Z

The owner started a new RunPod pod because the previous A100, gom4ualdk47qrj, could not get its GPU. The new pod is 1jyrnyxpb0n93s, name continuous_green_cephalopod, A100-SXM4-80GB, about $1.80/hr. The existing Global Volume is mounted at /workspace. Weights are at /workspace/models/Qwen3.5-27B/fc05daec18b0a78c049392ed2e771dde82bdf654. SSH for this pod: root@195.26.233.96 port 48443. The console on the owner's PC is http://127.0.0.1:18080/ through an SSH tunnel to the pod's 127.0.0.1:8080. That page is blank until the console process is listening.

Preflight passed at 2026-10-23T14:55:25Z: A100 81920 MiB, driver major 595, ports 8002, 8010, and 8080 free, runtime archive present. START.sh was then started and was restoring the runtime into /tmp/vllm-qwen-env. Source checked out by that start was f38cbef. GitHub main at the last save before this file was cf92c292b31698661658abdd5f90341c444f17ba. Confirm both SHAs before trusting them.

Acceptance was 4/9 overall and 4/8 mandatory. Production is NO-GO. Microsoft content match is not proven. The second Windows PC is not enrolled. Fresh recovery on this same PC does not close that gate. Model weights were not copied.

Next safe work: finish bringing up this pod's console, then continue product work that does not need a new GPU or a weight copy.

## LOG

- 2026-10-23T16:15Z Liaison file created. No product code in this commit. Cursor was starting the new pod. The local page was down because no tunnel was listening; a tunnel to port 18080 was opened from the owner's PC.
